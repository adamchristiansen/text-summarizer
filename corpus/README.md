The documents and data set structure were slightly modified. The changes are:

* The directories were renamed.
* The first 20 articles and summaries from each of the 5 categories (business,
  entertainment, politics, sport, and tech) were selected.
* Each article and summary were modified so that they have one sentence per
  line.
* The articles and summaries were corrected so that every sentence that
  appears in a summary also appears in its respective article in exactly the
  same way.
