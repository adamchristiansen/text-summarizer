# An extractive text summarizer

This is a project for the University of Lethbridge graduate level CPSC 5310
course, Advanced Data Processing. The strategies implemented are based on the
work of Gong and Liu.

## Running

The simple way to run the program is to open a shell and run:

```sh
$ sh run.sh
```

Alternatively, it can be run directly:

```sh
$ chmod a+x run.sh
$ ./run.sh
```

All of the generated data can be removed with:

```sh
$ ./run.sh --clean
```

## Programs

The following programs are included in the root directory:

* `lsm.py`: perform a summarization using latent semantic analysis.
* `prep.py`: preprocess the corpus into usable data.
* `rel.py`: perform a summarization using the relevance measure.
* `run.sh`: run all of the other scripts in the correct order.
